Hack-A-Week 19: A personal site built with React

### Usage:
- Visit https://ztaira14.github.io/

### Features:
- Easy way to display the things I've been up to

### What I liked:
The component-based architecture of React makes it very easy to break up your
massive HTML document into small, intuitive components. As a result, creating
a layout is much easier, since you only have to remember state and props for a
single component rather than the entire webpage.

### What I didn't like:
While the javascript is loading, the initial page is noticeably blank. This isn't
really a problem with fast internet speeds, but it was extremely noticeable
when I artificially throttled the network via Chrome's developer tools. I
think it'd be pretty cool if the bundling process also automatically populated
the initial HTML file in order to make the initial page load feel faster, but
that's a project for another day.
